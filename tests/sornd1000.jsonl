(PHP)","text":"<p>Nowadays, \"Prepared statements\" seem to be the only way anyone recommends sending queries to a database. I even see recommendations to use prepared statements for stored procs. However, do to the extra query prepared statements require - and the short time they last - I'm persuaded that they are only useful for a line of INSERT/UPDATE queries. </p>\n\n<p>I'm hoping someone can correct me on this, but it just seems like a repeat of the whole \"Tables are evil\" CSS thing. Tables are only evil if used for layouts - not tabular data. Using DIV's for tabular data is a style violation of WC3.</p>\n\n<p>Like wise, plain SQL (or that generated from AR's) seems to be much more useful for 80% of the queries used, which on most sites are a single SELECT not to be repeated again that page load (I'm speaking about scripting languages like PHP here). Why would I make my over-taxed DB prepare a statement that it is only to run once before being removed?</p>\n\n<p>MySQL:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A prepared statement is specific to\n  the session in which it was created.\n  If you terminate a session without\n  deallocating a previously prepared\n  statement, the server deallocates it\n  automatically.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So at the end of your script PHP will auto-close the connection and you will lose the prepared statement only to have your script re-created it on the next load.</p>\n\n<p>Am I missing something or is this just a way to decrease performance?</p>\n\n<p>:UPDATE:</p>\n\n<p>It dawned on me that I am assuming new connections for each script. I would assume that if a persistent connection is used then these problems would disappear. Is this correct?</p>\n\n<p>:UPDATE2:</p>\n\n<p>It seems that even if persistent connections are the solution - they are <a href=\"http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2006/11/12/are-php-persistent-connections-evil/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">not a very good option</a> for most of the web - especially if you use transactions. So I'm back to square one having nothing more than the benchmarks below to go on...</p>\n\n<p>:UPDATE3:</p>\n\n<p>Most people simply repeat the phrase \"prepared statements protect against SQL injection\" which doesn't full explain the problem. The provided \"escape\" method for each DB library <em>also protects against SQL injection</em>. But it is more than that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When sending a query the normal way,\n  the client (script) <em>converts the data\n  into strings</em> that are then passed to\n  the DB server. The DB server then uses\n  CPU power to <em>convert them back</em> into\n  the proper binary datatype. The\n  database engine then parses the\n  statement and looks for syntax errors.</p>\n  \n  <p>When using prepared statements... the\n  data are sent in a native binary form,\n  which saves the conversion-CPU-usage,\n  and makes the data transfer more\n  efficient. Obviously, this will also\n  reduce bandwidth usage if the client\n  is not co-located with the DB server.</p>\n  \n  <p>...The variable types are predefined,\n  and hence MySQL take into account\n  these characters, and they do not need\n  to be escaped.</p>\n  \n  <p><a href=\"http://www.webdesignforums.net/showthread.php?t=18762\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.webdesignforums.net/showthread.php?t=18762</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thanks to OIS for finally setting me strait on this issue.</p>\n","section":"StackOverlow","license":"CC-BY-SA-3.0"}

{"url":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/1516960","title":"Anatomy of a Distributed System in PHP","text":"<p>I've a problem which is giving me some hard time trying to figure it out the ideal solution and, to better explain it, I'm going to expose my scenario here.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I've a server that will receive orders\n  from several clients. Each client will\n  submit a set of recurring tasks that\n  should be executed at some specified\n  intervals, eg.: <strong><em>client A submits task\n  AA that should be executed every\n  minute between 2009-12-31 and\n  2010-12-31</em></strong>; so if my math is right\n  that's about 525 600 operations in a\n  year, given more clients and tasks\n  <strong>it would be infeasible to let the server process all these tasks</strong> so I\n  came up with the idea of worker\n  machines. The server will be developed\n  on PHP.</p>\n  \n  <p>Worker machines are just regular cheap\n  <strong>Windows-based</strong> computers that I'll\n  host on my home or at my workplace,\n  each worker will have a dedicated\n  Internet connection (<strong>with dynamic IPs</strong>)\n  and a UPS to avoid power outages. Each\n  worker will also query the server every\n  30 seconds or so via web service calls,\n  fetch the next pending job and process it.\n  Once the job is completed the worker will\n  submit the output to the server and request\n  a new job and so on ad infinitum. If\n  there is a need to scale the system I\n  should just set up a new worker and the\n  whole thing should run seamlessly.\n  The worker client will be developed\n  in PHP or Python.</p>\n  \n  <p>At any given time my clients should be\n  able to log on to the server and check\n  the status of the tasks they ordered.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now here is where the tricky part kicks in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>I must be able to reconstruct the\nalready processed tasks if for some\nreason the server goes down.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The workers are not client-specific,\none worker should process jobs for\nany given number of clients.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I've some doubts regarding the <strong>general database design</strong> and which technologies to use.</p>\n\n<p>Originally I thought of using several <strong>SQLite</strong> databases and <strong>joining them all on the server but I can't figure out how I would group by clients to generate the job reports</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>I've never actually worked with any of the following technologies: <strong>memcached</strong>, <strong>CouchDB</strong>, <strong>Hadoop</strong> and all the like, but I would like to know if any of these is suitable for my problem, and if yes which do you recommend for a newbie is \"distributed computing\" (or is this parallel?) like me. <strong>Please keep in mind that the workers have dynamic IPs.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Like I said before I'm also having trouble with the general database design, partly because I still haven't chosen any particular R(D)DBMS but one issue that I've and I think it's agnostic to the DBMS I choose is related to the <strong>queuing system</strong>... Should I <strong>precalculate all the absolute timestamps to a specific job and have a large set of timestamps</strong>, execute and flag them as complete in ascending order or should I have a more clever system like \"<strong><em>when timestamp modulus 60 == 0 -> execute</em></strong>\". The problem with this \"clever\" system is that <strong>some jobs will not be executed in order</strong> they should be because some workers could be waiting doing nothing while others are overloaded. <strong>What do you suggest?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>PS: I'm not sure if the title and tags of this question properly reflect my problem and what I'm trying to do; if not please edit accordingly.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your input!</p>\n\n<p><strong>@timdev:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The input will be a very small JSON encoded string, the output will also be a JSON enconded string but a bit larger (in the order of 1-5 KB).</li>\n<li>The output will be computed using several available resources from the Web so the main bottleneck will probably be the bandwidth.

I have done my due diligence in researching this topic before I posted it here.</p>\n\n<p>Most of my framework experience comes from using CodeIgniter, so I've never had hands-on experience using ORM. (CI does have some off-the-shelf ORM solutions, but I've never used them.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>I would like to use built-in ORM functionality in Laravel's Eloquent ORM to automatically join the tournaments and countries tables together when running a query</strong>, and return the data set that includes tournament data as well as its associated country data.</p>\n\n<p>That is, I want Eloquent to recognize the foreign key relationship automatically so that I can just run a query (e.g. Tournament:: with('Country')->all()) that will return the entire set of tournament and country data.</p>\n\n<p>Please stop me right now if I'm using Eloquent in a way that it was never intended to be used!

For example, I've heard that their default PHP configuration is very insecure (and apparently their admin app can't function without these holes being left open). This isn't terrible for a development situation, obviously, but you may end up relying on something like <code>register_globals</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I also spotted something else which makes me concerned: The developers recommend that Vista users disable UAC in order to use their software! </p>\n\n<p>For me that's a big red flag. Yes, there are problems with getting something like this running on Vista with UAC enabled, but disabling UAC should never be offered as a solution, especially for newbs (who need UAC more than anyone). It makes me very concerned.</p>\n\n<p><strong>WampServer</strong> apparently is easier to switch versions of PHP or Apache, if you need to. But it comes with less features than XAMPP (no FTP server, for example).</p>\n\n<p><strong>EasyPHP</strong> is one that I have no experience of, so I can't say, but it's apparently pretty popular, too.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Alternatives?</strong> There a ton of other stacks <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Apache%E2%80%93MySQL%E2%80%93PHP_packages\" rel=\"noreferrer\">listed on Wikipedia</a>. Do any of these come recommended?</p>\n\n<p>So which do you use, and why do you consider it the best?

I also alreay tried to swap <code>local_cert</code> and <code>local_pk</code> with each other, but it hasn't helped anyway.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> After researching a while, it turns out, that php fails with every combination with another error.</p>\n\n<p>My generated certificate files look like this:</p>\n\n<p><em>File /opt/psa/var/certificates/cert-0x8zHR:</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----\nsome letters\n-----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----\n\n-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nsome letters\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nsome letters\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nsome letters\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>File /opt/psa/var/certificates/cert-Du9H8N:</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nsome letters\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>All lines from the certificate strings from both of them end at character position 65.</p>\n\n<p>As you can read in php documentation, php expects to get a file in PEM format: <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/context.ssl.php#context.ssl.local-cert\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://php.net/manual/en/context.ssl.php#context.ssl.local-cert</a></p>\n\n<p>I found this tutorial to convert my two files into one PEM file, but my certificates look different to mentioned on the site and also I don't know what to exactly include into the PEM file, that php needs: <a href=\"https://www.digicert.com/ssl-support/pem-ssl-creation.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.digicert.com/ssl-support/pem-ssl-creation.htm</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> As mentioned below, here are the exact erros I get:</p>\n\n<p>with</p>\n\n<pre><code>stream_context_set_option($cont, 'ssl',  'local_pk', '/opt/psa/var/certificates/cert-0x8zHR');\nstream_context_set_option($cont, 'ssl', 'local_cert', '/opt/psa/var/certificates/cert-Du9H8N');\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Warning: stream_socket_accept(): Unable to set private key file\n  `/opt/psa/var/certificates/cert-0x8zHR' in ... on line ...</p>\n  \n  <p>Warning: stream_socket_accept(): Failed to enable crypto in ... on\n  line ...</p>\n  \n  <p>Warning: stream_socket_accept(): accept failed: Success in ... on line\n  ...</p>\n  \n  <p>Warning: socket_read() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean\n  given in ... on line ...</p>\n  \n  <p>Notice: Undefined offset: 1 in ... on line ...</p>\n  \n  <p>Warning: socket_write() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean\n  given in ... on line ...</p>\n  \n  <p>Warning: socket_write() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean\n  given in ... on line ...</p>\n  \n  <p>Warning: socket_write() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean\n  given in ... on line ...</p>\n  \n  <p>Warning: socket_write() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean\n  given in ... on line ...</p>\n  \n  <p>Warning: socket_write() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean\n  given in ... on line ...</p>\n  \n  <p>Warning: socket_write() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean\n  given in ... on line ...</p>\n  \n  <p>Warning: socket_close() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean\n  given in ... on line ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And with</p>\n\n<pre><code>stream_context_set_option($cont, 'ssl',  'local_cert', '/opt/psa/var/certificates/cert-0x8zHR');\nstream_context_set_option($cont, 'ssl', 'local_pk', '/opt/psa/var/certificates/cert-Du9H8N');\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Warning: stream_socket_accept(): Unable to set private key file\n  `/opt/psa/var/certificates/cert-Du9H8N' in ... on line ...</p>\n  \n  <p>Warning: stream_socket_accept(): Failed to enable crypto in ... on\n  line ...</p>\n  \n  <p>Warning: stream_socket_accept(): accept failed: Success in ... on line\n  ...</p>\n  \n  <p>Warning: socket_read() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean\n  given in ... on line ...</p>\n  \n  <p>Notice: Undefined offset: 1 in ... on line ...</p>\n  \n  <p>Warning: socket_write() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean\n  given in ... on line ...</p>\n  \n  <p>Warning: socket_write() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean\n  given in ... on line ...</p>\n  \n  <p>Warning: socket_write() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean\n  given in ... on line ...</p>\n  \n  <p>Warning: socket_write() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean\n  given in ... on line ...</p>\n  \n  <p>Warning: socket_write() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean\n  given in ... on line ...</p>\n  \n  <p>Warning: socket_write() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean\n  given in ... on line ...</p>\n  \n  <p>Warning: socket_close() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean\n  given in ... on line ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And with (just a concatenation of cert-0x8zHR with cert-Du9H8N)</p>\n\n<pre><code>$file = dirname(__FILE__, 3) . \\DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR .

All the posts that are discussing this later method are from 2009'ish.

The first is considered a \"hack\" that just checks if the post array has been set, which will happen if a post request is made. The second actually checks the server to see if a post request has been made.

I'm not sure how accurate that last statement is, because the questions being posed in the older posts are the same as mine. They use the post global and not request. However, this is a more recent post than any of the others (2011), and from a source I've come to trust. So I'm not sure what to make of it.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://forums.devshed.com/php-development-5/if-server-request-method-get-vs-if-isset-post-781746.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And what to do when checking for get? I've seen a couple of places say that the server request method doesn't seem to work in this instance, and I can only assume that it is because post supercedes get and the request method can only hold one paramter. So if you have both post and get data what do you do? A comment on one of these posts suggests using the request global instead of post and get, but I've been under the impression that is a bad idea.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://forums.devshed.com/php-development-5/if-server-request-method-get-vs-if-isset-post-781746.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/359047/php-detecting-request-type-get-post-put-or-delete\">Source</a> In answer comments (nickf)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10943060/isset-postsubmit-vs-serverrequest-method-post\">This</a> is the most recent source I could find, and I did so by looking through the similar questions on the side before submitting.

{"url":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/11167709","title":"PHP OOP a lot of setters, getters","text":"<p>I need to create approx. 5-7 classes, every class will contain a lot of members (let us say each class will contain 20 members). I could create them using public access, like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class A {\n    public $myPropertyOne = '';\n    public $myPropertyTwo = '';\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My preferred way of course to make these members private and create get/set methods for each property. I.e.</p>\n\n<pre><code>class A {\n    private $myPropertyOne = '';\n    private $myPropertyTwo = '';\n\n    public function getMyPropertyOne() {\n            return $this-&gt;myPropertyOne;\n    }\n\n    public function setMyPropertyOne($myPropertyOne) {\n            $this-&gt;myPropertyOne = $myPropertyOne;\n    }\n\n    public function getMyPropertyTwo() {\n            return $this-&gt;myPropertyTwo;\n    }\n\n    public function setMyPropertyTwo($myPropertyTwo) {\n            $this-&gt;myPropertyTwo = $myPropertyTwo;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But considering a class will have 20 properties, I will have in addition to this add 40 methods. And my concern here is how will this slow down the script and much more memory this will require (remember I am going to have several classes like this).</p>\n\n<p>Another solution could be to use magic functions __set, __get but I don't want to, because the code completion in development IDE will not suggest properties which is crucial for me.</p>\n\n<p>If this would be a compiled language (like C++) I would not have a question and would use the solution with getters, setters but since the PHP is interpreted language I am interested in my scripts to use less RAM and be as fast as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance, any thoughts regarding this question would be much appreciated!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>My Opinion</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thank you all for your answers, I just wanted to share my opinion in case someone will look for an answer to this question.</p>\n\n<p>I cannot fully agree with those who say that you should not care about performance as this is task of optimizers, I think this is important factor (well atleast as for me), when we're dealing with interpreted language such as PHP we will always have to think about memory and speed (this all reminds me the time when I was developing system apps for DOS, heh :) and you always have been limited with poor CPU and kilobytes of total RAM so you got happy if you could save an additional byte), in PHP development you have the same picture as regardless of how many server you add, users' count will be always higher so that you always have to decide if you want to follow classic/safe/proper method or to avoid this and get some gain in speed or memory. </p>\n\n<p>So.... my opinion is that the best way here is to use public access for all member and avoid getters/setters for all properties and use private access with get/set methods for properties which requires data validation or initialization before a value will be set.</p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class B {\n    public $myPropertyOne = '';\n    public $myPropertyTwo = '';\n    private $myPropertyThree = array();\n\n\n    public function getMyPropertyThree() {\n        return $this-&gt;myPropertyThree;\n    }\n\n    public function setMyPropertyThree($val) {\n        if(!is_array($val)) {\n            return;\n        }\n\n        $this-&gt;myPropertyThree = $val;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thank you for spending time on my question!</p>\n","section":"StackOverlow","license":"CC-BY-SA-3.0"}

{"url":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/2148114","title":"Why use output buffering in PHP?","text":"<p>I have read quite a bit of material on Internet where different authors suggest using output buffering. The funny thing is that most authors argument for its use only because it allows for mixing response headers with actual content. Frankly, I think that responsible web applications <strong>should not</strong> mix outputting headers and content, and web developers should look for possible logical flaws in their scripts which result in headers being sent after output has been generated. This is my first argument against the <code>ob_*</code> output buffering API. Even for that little convenience you get - mixing headers with output - it is not a good enough reason to use it, unless one needs to hack up scripts fast, which is usually not the goal nor the way in a serious web application. </p>\n\n<p>Also, I think most people dealing with the output buffering API do not think about the fact that even without the explicit output buffering enabled, PHP in combination with the web-server it is plugged into, <strong>still does some internal buffering</strong> anyway. It is easy to check - do an echo of some short string, sleep for say 10 seconds, and do another echo. Request your script with a browser and watch the blank page pause for 10 seconds, with both lines appearing thereafter. Before some say that it is a rendering artefact, not traffic, tracing the actual traffic between the client and the server shows that the server has generated the <code>Content-Length</code> header with an appropriate value for the entire output - suggesting that the output was not sent progressively with each <code>echo</code> call, but accumulated in some buffer and then sent on script termination. This is one of my gripes with explicit output buffering - why do we need two different output buffer implementations on top of one another? May it be because the internal (inaccessible) PHP/Web-server output buffering is subject to conditions a PHP developer cannot control, and is thus not really usable?</p>\n\n<p>In any case, I for one, start to think one should avoid explicit output buffering (the series of <code>ob_*</code> functions) and rely on the implicit one, assisting it with the good <code>flush</code> function, when necessary. Maybe if there was some guarantee from the web server to actually send output to the client with each echo/print call, then it would be useful to set up explicit buffering - after all one does not want to send response to the client with some 100 byte chunks. But the alternative with two buffers seems like a somewhat useless layer of abstraction.</p>\n\n<p>So, ultimately, do serious web applications need output buffering?</p>\n","section":"StackOverlow","license":"CC-BY-SA-3.0"}

First we needed to read these waterfalls. Thanks all for your suggestions on the waterfall readout analysis. Evident from the various waterfall graphs shown here is the main bottleneck: the PHP-generated thumbnails. The protocol-less jquery loading from CDN advised by David got my bounty, albeit making my site only 3% faster overall, and while not answering the site's main bottleneck. Time for for clarification of my question, and, another bounty:</p>\n<p><strong>Question Part B</strong> \u2589 (100 bountys, awarded)<br />\nThe new focus was now to solve the problem that the 6 jpg images had, which are causing the most of the loading-delay. These 6 images are PHP-generated thumbnails, tiny and only 3~5 kb, but loading relatively <em>very</em> slowly. Notice the &quot;<em>time to first byte</em>&quot; on the various graphs. The problem remained unsolved, but a bounty went to James, who fixed the header error that RedBot <a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FLWNX.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">underlined</a>: <em>&quot;An If-Modified-Since conditional request returned the full content unchanged.&quot;</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Question Part C</strong> \u2589 (my last bounty: 250 points)<br />\nUnfortunately, after even REdbot.org header error was fixed, the delay caused by the PHP-generated images remained untouched. What on earth are these tiny puny 3~5Kb thumbnails thinking? All that header information can send a rocket to moon and back. Any suggestions on this bottleneck is much appreciated and treated as possible answer, since I am stuck at this bottleneckish problem for already seven months now.</p>\n<p>[Some background info on my site: CSS is at the top.

{"url":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/19326855","title":"Laravel 4 - Child constructor call parent constructor with dependency injection","text":"<p>I'm building a CMS using Laravel 4 and I have a base admin controller for the admin pages that looks something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class AdminController extends BaseController {\n\n    public function __construct(UserAuthInterface $auth, MessagesInterface $message, ModuleManagerInterface $module)\n    {\n        $this-&gt;auth = $auth;\n        $this-&gt;user = $this-&gt;auth-&gt;adminLoggedIn();\n        $this-&gt;message = $message;\n        $this-&gt;module = $module;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Im using Laravel's IOC container to inject the class dependencies into the constructor. I then have various controller classes that control the different modules that make up the CMS and each class extends the admin class. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class UsersController extends AdminController {\n\n    public function home()\n    {\n        if (!$this-&gt;user)\n        {\n            return Redirect::route('admin.login');\n        }\n        $messages = $this-&gt;message-&gt;getMessages();\n        return View::make('users::home', compact('messages'));\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now this works perfectly however my problem, which is less of a problem and more of a efficiency issue, occurs when I add a constructor to the <code>UsersController</code> class. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class UsersController extends AdminController {\n\n    public function __construct(UsersManager $user)\n    {\n        $this-&gt;users = $users;\n    }\n\n    public function home()\n    {\n        if (!$this-&gt;user)\n        {\n        return Redirect::route('admin.login');\n        }\n        $messages = $this-&gt;message-&gt;getMessages();\n        return View::make('users::home', compact('messages'));\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since the child class now has a constructor it means the parent's constructor isn't getting called and thus things the child class is dependant on, such as <code>this-&gt;user</code> are no longer valid, causing errors. I can call the admin controller's construct function via <code>parent::__construct()</code> however since I need to pass it the class dependencies I need to set these dependencies in the child constructor resulting in something that looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class UsersController extends AdminController {\n\n    public function __construct(UsersManager $user, UserAuthInterface $auth, MessagesInterface $message, ModuleManagerInterface $module)\n    {\n        parent::__construct($auth, $messages, $module);\n        $this-&gt;users = $users;\n    }\n\n    // Same as before\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now this works fine in terms of its functionality; however it doesn't seem very efficient to me to have to include the parent's dependencies in every child class that has a constructor. It also looks quite messy. Does Laravel provide a way around this, or does PHP support a way of calling both the parent and child constructor without having to call <code>parent::__construct()</code> from the child?</p>\n\n<p>I know this is a long question for what is effectively not a problem but more me just be ocd about efficiency, but I appreciate any ideas and/or solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n","section":"StackOverlow","license":"CC-BY-SA-3.0"}

The <a href=\"https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/reference/working-with-objects.html#title.1.3\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\"Persisting entities\"</a> documentation says the following about a call to <code>persist()</code> for object <code>X</code>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If X is a preexisting managed entity, it is ignored by the persist operation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That leads me to believe that <code>persist()</code> need only be called when the object is new and has not yet been saved to the database. However, the documentation for the <a href=\"https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/reference/change-tracking-policies.html#title.1.2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\"Deferred Explicit\" change tracking policy</a> says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... Doctrine 2 only considers entities that have been explicitly marked for change detection through a call to EntityManager#persist(entity) ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>... which sounds like <code>persist()</code> must be called on the object for it to be updated at all. When should <code>persist()</code> be called? If only on new objects, is there a significance performance hit to call it anyway whenever an entity is updated and let Doctrine sort out the difference?</p>\n","section":"StackOverlow","license":"CC-BY-SA-3.0"}

{"url":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/492307","title":"Uploading big files over HTTP","text":"<p>I need to upload potentially big (as in, 10's to 100's of megabytes) files from a desktop application to a server. The server code is written in PHP, the desktop application in C++/MFC. I want to be able to resume file uploads when the upload fails halfway through because this software will be used over unreliable connections. What are my options? I've found a number of HTTP upload components for C++, such as <a href=\"http://www.chilkatsoft.com/refdoc/vcCkUploadRef.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.chilkatsoft.com/refdoc/vcCkUploadRef.html</a> which looks excellent, but it doesn't seem to handle 'resume' of half done uploads (I assume this is because HTTP 1.1 doesn't support it). I've also looked at the BITS service but for uploads it requires an IIS server. So far my only option seems to be to cut up the file I want to upload into smaller pieces (say 1 meg each), upload them all to the server, reassemble them with PHP and run a checksum to see if everything went ok. To resume, I'd need to have some form of 'handshake' at the beginning of the upload to find out which pieces are already on the server. Will I have to code this by hand or does anyone know of a library that does all this for me, or maybe even a completely different solution? I'd rather not switch to another protocol that supports resume natively for maintenance reasons (potential problems with firewalls etc.)</p>\n","section":"StackOverlow","license":"CC-BY-SA-3.0"}

When the server receives a RST_STREAM, it will stop sending DATA frames to the client, thereby stopping the response (or the download). The connection is still usable for other requests, and requests/responses that were concurrent with the one that has been aborted may continue to progress.\n[...]\nIt is possible that by the time the RST_STREAM travels from the client to the server, the whole content of the request is in transit and will arrive to the client, which will discard it. However, for large response contents, sending a RST_STREAM may have a good chance to arrive to the server before the whole response content is sent, and therefore will save bandwidth.</em>&quot;</p>\n<p>The described behavior is the same as the one I can observe. But that would mean the browser is the culprit, and then I wouldn't understand why it happens on two identical pages with one having a 200 header and the other a 404 (same goes if I disable JS).</p>\n","section":"StackOverlow","license":"CC-BY-SA-3.0"}

I need to keep this input format available to admins because there are several nodes (pages) and panel panes that make use of small, harmless php code snippets, like embedding a specific form into the content region, for example.</p>\n\n<p>The issue is that if someone were to compromise an admin account, then they could run arbitrary php code on the site, and thus run shell commands via php's <code>exec</code>, <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/function.passthru.php\"><code>passthru</code></a>, etc. Is there any way, from an operating system level, to restrict what shell commands php can pass through to the machine?

I have created a logging plugin to hopefully help track the frequency of the out of stock messages and hopefully help correlate the message with any actions taken place on the website.

For example, if a user is coming from a store called Farmer's Market, there may be customized content or extra links available to that user, specific to that particular store. file_exists() is used to determine if there are any customized portions of the page that need to be imported.</p>\n\n<p>Up until now, we've been using a relatively insecure method, in which the item ID# and the store are simply passed in as GET parameters, and the system knows to apply them to each of the links within the page. However, we're switching to a reversible hash method, in which the store and item number are encrypted (to look something like \"gd651hd8h41dg0h81\"), and the pages simply decode them and assign the store and ID variables.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, however, we've been running into an error that Googling extensively hasn't found me an answer for. There are several similar blocks of code, but they all look something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$buttons_first = \"../stores/\" . $store . \"/buttons_first.php\";\n\nif(file_exists($buttons_first))\n{\n    include($buttons_first);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(The /stores/ directory is actually in the directory above the working one, hence the ../)</p>\n\n<p>Fairly straightforward.

{"url":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/8617371","title":"PHPUnit - Writing a test class for an interface, and testing objects using a factory","text":"<p>I am writing a class that will inherit an interface. The client code will be written for that interface, and the class written to support it. The idea is that I will later write other classes for that interface, and objects of those two different classes should be completely interchangeable. Rather than writing a test class for that first class, I want to write one for the interface.</p>\n\n<p>My plan was to write a test class that would take a factory object for the constructor (dependency injection), and use the factory to create new instances of the class under test.</p>\n\n<p>That way, if I wanted to test ClassA, I could pass a ClassAFactory object to the constructor of the test class, and if I wanted to test ClassB, I would pass a ClassBFactory object. Both classes are designed to be interchangeable, and since only public methods are supposed to be tested, this seems ideal.</p>\n\n<p>But what about testing the constructor? Would I be better writing an abstract test class and implmenting constructor tests in classes that inherit the abstract test class (different classes may be instantiated differently)?</p>\n\n<p>If I did use the first idea, I guess I would have a test class for each class being tested, like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class ClassATest extends [PHPUnit test case]\n{\n    $myFactory = new ClassAFactory();\n    $myTest = new ClassTest($myFactory);\n\n    $myTest-&gt;test1();\n    $myTest-&gt;test2();\n    //etc.\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What's the best way to go about this? I want to have a general test, so that when I write new classes to implement the common interface, I can just put an object of the same tests as used for the others. But, seeing as the different classes would have different constructors, perhaps writing an abstract test class and extending it for each new object would be better? What do you think?</p>\n","section":"StackOverlow","license":"CC-BY-SA-3.0"}

The general idea is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Create an image on an HTML5 Canvas using a generative algorithm</li>\n<li>When the image is completed, allow users to save the canvas as an image file to the server</li>\n<li>Allow the user to either download the image or add it to a gallery of pieces of produced using the algorithm.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>However, I\u2019m stuck on the second step. After some help from Google, I found this <a href=\"http://permadi.com/blog/2010/10/html5-saving-canvas-image-data-using-php-and-ajax/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">blog post</a>, which seemed to be exactly what I wanted:</p>\n\n<p>Which led to the JavaScript code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function saveImage() {\n  var canvasData = canvas.toDataURL(\"image/png\");\n  var ajax = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n  ajax.open(\"POST\", \"testSave.php\", false);\n  ajax.onreadystatechange = function() {\n    console.log(ajax.responseText);\n  }\n  ajax.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/upload\");\n  ajax.send(\"imgData=\" + canvasData);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and corresponding PHP (testSave.php):</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\nif (isset($GLOBALS[\"HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA\"])) {\n  $imageData = $GLOBALS['HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA'];\n  $filteredData = substr($imageData, strpos($imageData, \",\") + 1);\n  $unencodedData = base64_decode($filteredData);\n  $fp = fopen('/path/to/file.png', 'wb');\n\n  fwrite($fp, $unencodedData);\n  fclose($fp);\n}\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But this doesn\u2019t seem to do anything at all.</p>\n\n<p>More Googling turns up this <a href=\"http://www.kevinsookocheff.com/2011/07/27/saving-canvas-data-to-an-image-file-with-javascript-and-php/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">blog post</a> which is based off of the previous tutorial. Not very different, but perhaps worth a try:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$data = $_POST['imgData'];\n$file = \"/path/to/file.png\";\n$uri = substr($data,strpos($data, \",\") + 1);\n\nfile_put_contents($file, base64_decode($uri));\necho $file;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This one creates a file (yay) but it\u2019s corrupted and doesn\u2019t seem to contain anything. It also appears to be empty (file size of 0).</p>\n\n<p>Is there anything really obvious that I\u2019m doing wrong? The path where I\u2019m storing my file is writable, so that isn\u2019t an issue, but nothing seems to be happening and I\u2019m not really sure how to debug this.</p>\n\n<h3>Edit</h3>\n\n<p>Following Salvidor Dali\u2019s link I changed the AJAX request to be:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function saveImage() {\n  var canvasData = canvas.toDataURL(\"image/png\");\n  var xmlHttpReq = false;\n\n  if (window.XMLHttpRequest) {\n    ajax = new XMLHttpRequest();\n  }\n  else if (window.ActiveXObject) {\n    ajax = new ActiveXObject(\"Microsoft.XMLHTTP\");\n  }\n\n  ajax.open(\"POST\", \"testSave.php\", false);\n  ajax.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\");\n  ajax.onreadystatechange = function() {\n    console.log(ajax.responseText);\n  }\n  ajax.send(\"imgData=\" + canvasData);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And now the image file is created and isn\u2019t empty! It seems as if the content type matters and that changing it to <code>x-www-form-urlencoded</code> allowed the image data to be sent.</p>\n\n<p>The console returns the (rather large) string of base64 code and the datafile is ~140 kB. However, I still can\u2019t open it and it seems to not be formatted as an image.</p>\n","section":"StackOverlow","license":"CC-BY-SA-3.0"}

It seems like the recipe for bad performance at least.</p>\n\n<p>In the alternative, which is to make multiple containers, I still don't get how the ever-stinking Singletons are not needed anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say that I would have the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$session_container = new bucket_Container();\n$session_container-&gt;create('Database');\n$session_container-&gt;create('Database_Sessions');\n\n$log_container = new bucket_Container();\n$log_container-&gt;create('Database');\n$log_container-&gt;create('Database_Log');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So here we have two containers, or in this case <em>buckets</em> for two totally different usages which are mutual by their dependency on the <code>Database</code> class.</p>\n\n<p>My logic tells me that the above code will create two independent instances of the <code>Database</code>-class, meaning that I still would have to make the <code>Database</code>-class a singleton to ensure that concurrent instances of my database connection isn't occurring?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this correct?</strong></p>\n","section":"StackOverlow","license":"CC-BY-SA-3.0"}

I have a class that will be instantiated many times within the same page load.  In that class, I have some properties that will always be the same across every object, so I'm thinking about declaring these properties as <code>static</code> in an effort to reduce the memory that will be used when multiple instances of this class are instantiated during the same page request.</p>\n\n<p>Will doing this use less memory for this application because PHP can store the value of the static properties only once?  Will doing this save memory across concurrent users, or just within each PHP process?</p>\n\n<p>How does this work for methods?  If this means objects can recycle the same methods, then why wouldn't all methods of a class be declared static if you are trying to save on memory?</p>\n\n<p>I don't feel entirely comfortable with why and when one would declare a property or method static, but I do understand that declaring them as static allows them to be accessed without instantiating an object of the class ( this feels like a hack ... these methods and properties should be somewhere else ... no? ). I'm specifically interested in the way a <code>static</code> declaration affects memory usage in an effort to keep memory usage as low as possible on my web server ... and in general so I have a better understanding of what is going on.</p>\n","section":"StackOverlow","license":"CC-BY-SA-3.0"}

Now, however it seems that everything matches, including stuff I don't want, however, although it seems to match it doesn't go in the query string unless it is a regular A-Za-z_- character string.  </p>\n\n<p>I find this confusing, because the rule says put whatever you matched into the query string:</p>\n\n<p>Here is the original rule:</p>\n\n<pre><code>RewriteRule ^/puzzle/([A-Za-z_-]+)$ /puzzle.php?g=$1 [NC]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and here is the revised rule:</p>\n\n<pre><code>RewriteRule ^/puzzle/(\\w+)$ /puzzle.php?g=$1 [NC]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I made the change because somewhere I read that \\w matches ALL the alpha chars where as A-Zetc. only matches the ones without accents and stuff.  </p>\n\n<p>It doesn't seem to matter which of those rules I use:  Here is what happens:  </p>\n\n<p>In the application I have this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>echo $_GET['g'];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If I feed it a url like <a href=\"http://mydomain.com/puzzle/USA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://mydomain.com/puzzle/USA</a>  it echoes out \"USA\" and works fine.<br>\nIf I feed it a url like <a href=\"http://mydomain.com/puzzle/M%C3%A9xico\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://mydomain.com/puzzle/M\u00e9xico</a> it echoes nothing for that and warns me that index g is not defined and of course doesn't get resources for Mexico.<br>\nif I feed it a url like <a href=\"http://mydomain.com/puzzle/fuzzle/buzzle/j.qle\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://mydomain.com/puzzle/fuzzle/buzzle/j.qle</a> it does the same thing.<br>\nThis last case should be a 404!  </p>\n\n<p>And it does this no matter which of the above rules I use.  I configured a rewrite log </p>\n\n<pre><code>   RewriteLogLevel 5\n   RewriteLog /opt/local/apache2/logs/puzzles.httpd.rewrite\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but it is empty.   </p>\n\n<p>Here is from the regular access log (it gives a status of 200)  </p>\n\n<pre><code>[26/May/2010:11:21:42 -0700] \"GET /puzzle/M%C3%A9xico HTTP/1.1\" 200 342\n[26/May/2010:11:21:54 -0700] \"GET /puzzle/M/l.foo HTTP/1.1\" 200 342\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What can I do to get these $%#$@(*#@!!! characters but not slash, dot or other non-alpha into my program, and once there, will it decode them correctly???   Would posix char classes work any better?  Is there anything else I need to configure?  </p>\n","section":"StackOverlow","license":"CC-BY-SA-3.0"}

{"url":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/19249159","title":"Best practice multi language website","text":"<p>I've been struggling with this question for quite some months now, but I haven't been in a situation that I needed to explore all possible options before. Right now, I feel like it's time to get to know the possibilities and create my own personal preference to use in my upcoming projects.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Let me first sketch the situation I'm looking for</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'm about to upgrade/redevelop a content management system which I've been using for quite a while now. However, I'm feeling multi language is a great improvement to this system. Before I did not use any frameworks but I'm going to use Laraval4 for the upcoming project. Laravel seems the best choice of a cleaner way to code PHP. <code>Sidenote: Laraval4 should be no factor in your answer</code>. I'm looking for general ways of translation that are platform/framework independent.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What should be translated</strong></p>\n\n<p>As the system I am looking for needs to be as user friendly as possible the method of managing the translation should be inside the CMS. There should be no need to start up an FTP connection to modify translation files or any html/php parsed templates.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, I'm looking for the easiest way to translate multiple database tables perhaps without the need of making additional tables.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What did I come up with myself</strong></p>\n\n<p>As I've been searching, reading and trying things myself already. There are a couple of options I have. But I still don't feel like I've reached a best practice method for what I am really seeking. Right now, this is what I've come up with, but this method also has it side effects.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>PHP Parsed Templates</strong>: the template system should be parsed by PHP. This way I'm able to insert the translated parameters into the HTML without having to open the templates and modify them. Besides that, PHP parsed templates gives me the ability to have 1 template for the complete website instead of having a subfolder for each language (which I've had before). The method to reach this target can be either Smarty, TemplatePower, Laravel's Blade or any other template parser. As I said this should be independent to the written solution.</li>\n<li><strong>Database Driven</strong>: perhaps I don't need to mention this again. But the solution should be database driven. The CMS is aimed to be object oriented and MVC, so I would need to think of a logical data structure for the strings. As my templates would be structured: templates/Controller/View.php perhaps this structure would make the most sense: <code>Controller.View.parameter</code>. The database table would have these fields a long with a <code>value</code> field. Inside the templates we could use some sort method like <code>echo __('Controller.View.welcome', array('name', 'Joshua'))</code> and the parameter contains <code>Welcome, :name</code>. Thus the result being <code>Welcome, Joshua</code>. This seems a good way to do this, because the parameters such as :name are easy to understand by the editor.</li>\n<li><strong>Low Database Load</strong>: Of course the above system would cause loads of database load if these strings are being loaded on the go. Therefore I would need a caching system that re-renders the language files as soon as they are edited/saved in the administration environment. Because files are generated, also a good file system layout is needed. I guess we can go with <code>languages/en_EN/Controller/View.php</code> or .ini, whatever suits you best. Perhaps an .ini is even parsed quicker in the end. This fould should contain the data in the <code>format parameter=value;</code>\n. I guess this is the best way of doing this, since each View that is rendered can include it's own language file if it exists. Language parameters then should be loaded to a specific view and not in a global scope to prevent parameters from overwriting each other.</li>\n<li><strong>Database Table translation</strong>: this in fact is the thing I'm most worried about. I'm looking for a way to create translations of News/Pages/etc. as quickly as possible. Having two tables for each module (for example <code>News</code> and <code>News_translations</code>) is an option but it feels like to much work to get a good system. One of the things I came up with is based on a <code>data versioning</code> system I wrote: there is one database table name <code>Translations</code>, this table has a unique combination of <code>language</code>, <code>tablename</code> and <code>primarykey</code>. For instance: en_En / News / 1 (Referring to the English version of the News item with ID=1). But there are 2 huge disadvantages to this method: first of all this table tends to get pretty long with a lot of data in the database and secondly it would be a hell of a job to use this setup to search the table. E.g. searching for the SEO slug of the item would be a full text search, which is pretty dumb. But on the other hand: it's a quick way to create translatable content in every table very fast, but I don't believe this pro overweights the con's.</li>\n<li><strong>Front-end Work</strong>: Also the front-end would need some thinking. Of course we would store the available languages in a database and (de)active the ones we need. This way the script can generate a dropdown to select a language and the back-end can decide automatically what translations can be made using the CMS. The chosen language (e.g. en_EN) would then be used when getting the language file for a view or to get the right translation for a content item on the website.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So, there they are. My ideas so far. They don't even include localization options for dates etc yet, but as my server supports PHP5.3.2+ the best option is to use the intl extension as explained here: <a href=\"http://devzone.zend.com/1500/internationalization-in-php-53/\">http://devzone.zend.com/1500/internationalization-in-php-53/</a> - but this would be of use in any later stadium of development. For now the main issue is how to have the best practics of translation of the content in a website.</p>\n\n<p>Besides everything I explained here, I still have another thing which I haven't decided yet, it looks like a simple question, but in fact it's been giving me headaches:</p>\n\n<p><strong>URL Translation? Should we do this or not? and in what way?</strong></p>\n\n<p>So.. if I have this url: <code>http://www.domain.com/about-us</code> and English is my default language. Should this URL be translated into <code>http://www.domain.com/over-ons</code> when I choose Dutch as my language? Or should we go the easy road and simply change the content of the page visible at <code>/about</code>. The last thing doesn't seem a valid option because that would generate multiple versions of the same URL, this indexing the content will fail the right way.</p>\n\n<p>Another option is using <code>http://www.domain.com/nl/about-us</code> instead. This generates at least a unique URL for each content. Also this would be easier to go to another language, for example <code>http://www.domain.com/en/about-us</code> and the URL provided is easier to understand for both Google and Human visitors. Using this option, what do we do with the default languages? Should the default language remove the language selected by default? So redirecting <code>http://www.domain.com/en/about-us</code> to <code>http://www.domain.com/about-us</code> ... In my eyes this is the best solution, because when the CMS is setup for only one language there is no need to have this language identification in the URL.</p>\n\n<p>And a third option is a combination from both options: using the \"language-identification-less\"-URL (<code>http://www.domain.com/about-us</code>) for the main language. And use an URL with a translated SEO slug for sublanguages: <code>http://www.domain.com/nl/over-ons</code> &amp; <code>http://www.domain.com/de/uber-uns</code></p>\n\n<p>I hope my question gets your heads cracking, they cracked mine for sure! It did help me already to work things out as a question here. Gave me a possibility to review the methods I've used before and the idea's I'm having for my upcoming CMS.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to thank you already for taking the time to read this bunch of text!</p>\n\n<p><code>// Edit #1</code>: </p>\n\n<p>I forgot to mention: the __() function is an alias to translate a given string. Within this method there obviously should be some sort of fallback method where the default text is loaded when there are not translations available yet. If the translation is missing it should either be inserted or the translation file should be regenerated.</p>\n","section":"StackOverlow","license":"CC-BY-SA-3.0"}
